###### INSTRUCTIONS:
    
The main elements of this crawler are Selenium and Headless Chrome, which are used to render sites and 
then to scrape images and links. 

STEPS:

    1. Install all the required packages to your python interpreter
        - psycopg2
        - requests
        - selenium
        - bs4
        
    2. The chrome driver is already present in the directory, so you don't need to download it
    
    3. Start the crawler by running the start.py script
        - The script creates a Crawler class and runs it
        - The number of processes are set as an argument for the crawler

VISUALIZATION:

    When you want to visualize fresh data from the database, you first have to run export.py script. It fetches data
    from the db and exports it to json files which are placed into corresponding directory. 
    
    There are two visualisations available: links and pages. Each visualisation can be displayed running html script in 
    the corresponding subdirectory (visualisation/...).
    
    Note that amount of visualized data is limited due to performance and usability reasons.
